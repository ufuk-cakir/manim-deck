This folder contains the code for my talk on how to use manim for research animations and presentation, given at the A2I group meeting on February 20, 2026.

The source code provides some pointers and examples on how to create simple animations!


If you want to have a feel on how giving a talk looks like, I also included the html and assets, so you should be able to just open the html file and use the arrow keys to navigate through the slides.

I hope so atleast
